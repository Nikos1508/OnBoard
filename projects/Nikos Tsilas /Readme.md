# Nfc card
## A nfc card with information for me and my projects
##### When you scan it with your phone it shows some of my projects, my email and some personal information. It is something like a very cool business card.

## Plan
##### This card will cost 29.58 euro.

## Design
##### I made a nfc card with Easyeda. Î™ made it with the guidance of the jam. The wire connections was pretty easy.
